# Virtual File System

This was an obligatory assignment for IN2140. It involved reading a
"superblock" from disk and simulating a filesystem in memory using inodes.

Running (swap out the directory with what you would like to test):

```
$ make
$ cd create_example1
$ ./create_fs1
```

Don't use this code if you are currently studying IN2140!
